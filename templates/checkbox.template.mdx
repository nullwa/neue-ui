## Overview

The Checkbox component is a form control that allows users to select one or multiple options from a set. It's essential for forms, settings panels, filters, and anywhere binary or multi-select choices are needed—such as accepting terms and conditions, toggling features, or selecting items from a list.

The component provides clear visual feedback with multiple color variants (default, brand, secondary, error, success) to indicate different states or validation results. It supports accessible labeling with both a primary label and an optional hint text for additional context or instructions. The bordered option adds visual emphasis when needed, and the disabled state prevents interaction when choices aren't available. Whether used standalone or in groups, the Checkbox component maintains consistency and accessibility across your application's forms and selection interfaces.
