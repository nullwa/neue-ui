## Overview

The Radio component allows users to select a single option from a set of mutually exclusive choices. It's essential for forms, surveys, settings, and anywhere users need to make one selection from multiple options—such as choosing a subscription plan, selecting a payment method, or picking a shipping option.

The component provides clear visual feedback with multiple color variants (default, brand, secondary, error, success) to indicate different states or validation results. It supports accessible labeling with both a primary label and an optional hint text for additional context or instructions. The bordered option adds visual emphasis when needed, while the direction property (leading or trailing) controls whether the radio button appears before or after the label text, accommodating different design patterns. The disabled state prevents interaction when options aren't available. Radio buttons should always be used in groups where only one option can be selected at a time, unlike checkboxes which allow multiple selections.
