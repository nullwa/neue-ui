## Overview

The Badge component is a compact, versatile element used to display labels, categories, tags, status indicators, and notification counts. It's perfect for highlighting important information, categorizing content, or drawing attention to specific items throughout your application.

The component supports multiple visual variants (primary, outline, error, success, warning, brand, ghost), optional icons from Lucide, numerical counters, and removable functionality with an X button. Badges can be styled with different border radius options (squared or pilled) to match your design system, making them ideal for filter chips, user tags, notification badges, or any contextual labeling needs.
