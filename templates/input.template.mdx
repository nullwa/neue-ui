## Overview

The Input component is a fundamental form control that enables users to enter and edit text data. It's essential for collecting user information across various contexts—from search bars and login forms to profile settings and data entry interfaces.

The component offers multiple visual variants (default, error, success, warning) to provide instant validation feedback, helping users understand the state of their input. It supports three size options for different design contexts, configurable border radius (squared or pilled), and flexible addon functionality that can display text prefixes (like "http://"), icons from Lucide, or custom React elements on either side of the input. The addon can be made clickable through the onValidateInput callback, enabling interactive features like password visibility toggles or input clearing. Whether used for simple text entry or complex form validation, the Input component adapts to your needs while maintaining consistency and accessibility.
