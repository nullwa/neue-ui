## Overview

The Tooltip component provides contextual information when users hover over or focus on an element. Built with Radix UI, it's perfect for explaining icon buttons, providing additional context for form fields, displaying keyboard shortcuts, or offering helpful hints without cluttering the interface.

The component supports flexible content with both a title and optional description for more detailed explanations. It offers configurable placement options (top, right, bottom, left) to adapt to different layout contexts and avoid edge overflow. The optional arrow creates a clear visual connection between the tooltip and its trigger element, while the customizable delay controls how quickly tooltips appear to prevent accidental triggers during cursor movement. Tooltips can be completely disabled when needed, making them ideal for responsive designs where touch devices might require alternative help mechanisms. Whether providing micro-copy for icons or detailed explanations for complex features, the Tooltip enhances usability without adding visual noise.
