## Overview

The Switch component is a toggle control that represents an on/off state, similar to a physical light switch. It's ideal for settings panels, feature toggles, preference controls, and anywhere users need to enable or disable a single option with immediate effect—such as dark mode toggles, notification settings, or privacy controls.

The component provides clear visual feedback with multiple color variants (default, brand, error) to indicate different states or validation results. It supports accessible labeling with both a primary label and an optional hint text for additional context or instructions. The bordered option adds visual emphasis when needed, while configurable border radius (squared or pilled) allows you to match your design system aesthetics. The disabled state prevents interaction when the option isn't available. Unlike checkboxes which are typically used for form submissions, switches are designed for instant state changes and real-time settings, providing immediate visual feedback through smooth animations.
