## Overview

The Breadcrumb component provides hierarchical navigation that shows users their current location within the application's structure. It automatically generates a clickable path from a given pathname, making it easy for users to navigate back through parent pages without using the browser's back button.

Built with Radix Slot and Lucide icons, the component intelligently handles long paths by collapsing them into an ellipsis when needed, preventing overflow while maintaining navigation functionality. This makes it perfect for deep navigation structures like documentation sites, file systems, multi-level dashboards, or any application with nested page hierarchies. The component automatically parses the pathname and creates interactive links for each segment of the path.
