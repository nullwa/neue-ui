## Overview

The Avatar component is used to represent a user or entity with an image, icon, or initials. It provides a consistent way to display user profiles throughout your application—in navigation headers, comment sections, user lists, or anywhere visual identification is needed.

The component gracefully handles different states:

- Displaying profile images when available.
- Falling back to user initials when no image is provided or showing a placeholder icon
- It supports multiple sizes and variants to fit various design contexts, from compact inline mentions to prominent profile displays.
