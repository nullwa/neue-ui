## Overview

The Accordion component provides an elegant solution for displaying collapsible content sections. It's ideal for organizing large amounts of information in a compact, scannable format—such as FAQs, product details, or documentation sections.

Users can expand items to reveal content and collapse them to conserve space. The component offers flexible behavior options: limit users to viewing one section at a time, or allow multiple sections to remain open simultaneously.
