## Overview

The Progress Bar component visualizes the completion status of tasks, processes, or operations. It's ideal for showing upload/download progress, form completion, loading states, onboarding steps, or any process that unfolds over time.

The component offers flexible label positioning options (right, bottom, top-floating, bottom-floating) to accommodate different layouts and design needs. It supports multiple color variants (brand, error, success, warning, default) to convey different states—such as normal progress, completion success, or error conditions. The component includes a customizable value formatter that allows you to display progress as percentages, fractions, or custom text formats. With configurable min/max ranges and additional styling options through className props, the Progress Bar adapts to various use cases while providing clear visual feedback about task completion status.
