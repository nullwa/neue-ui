## Overview

The Button component is a fundamental interactive element built with modern web standards and styled with Tailwind CSS. It provides a versatile, accessible foundation for all clickable actions throughout your application—from form submissions and navigation to triggering dialogs and confirming actions.

The component offers extensive customization options including multiple visual variants (default, outline, error, success, warning, brand, ghost), three size options, configurable border radius (rounded or pilled), and optional loading states with spinners. It seamlessly integrates Lucide icons in leading or trailing positions, supports a fancy border style for premium interactions, and accepts additional Tailwind utility classes for one-off customizations. Whether you need primary CTAs, subtle ghost buttons, or destructive actions, this component adapts to every use case while maintaining consistency across your design system.
