## Overview
Buttons are clickable elements that are used to trigger actions. They communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways. `Button` labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Overview}/>

### Button with icon
Once the icons are imported, you can pass them directly in to the `Button` component. Keep in mind, you will also need to add an iconDescription to help with screen-reader support if you use the renderIcon prop. If you are trying to render an icon-only button, please refer to the section on the hasIconOnly prop
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.HasIcon}/>
To render an `icon` of a different size, pass a size prop on the Icon to ensure the proper classes are applied:

## Controls
Additional props passed into `Button` will be forwarded along to the underlying button element.
<Primary/>
<Controls/>
