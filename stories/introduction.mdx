## Introduction

Neue UI is a comprehensive open-source React library of React components built using TypeScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS, it provides everything you need to create modern, accessible interfaces.
Simply copy, paste, and accelerate your development process and save valuable time with production-ready, pixel-perfect components.

Start your next project with confidence — Neue offers a robust foundation for building beautiful, responsive web applications.

## How is this different from a library?

Unlike traditional component libraries that are installed as a dependency, Neue UI React gives you the source code.

When you select a component, its code is added directly to your project. This means no package dependencies to manage and no vendor lock-in! You have full control to modify, extend, or adapt the components to your specific needs—because you own the code.
